# it's nice to meet you :)

I'm **Houlton McGuinn,** a software engineer and security researcher. I work at [Retool](https://www.retool.com), securing the fastest way to develop effective software.

I graduated from [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.cs.unc.edu) in December 2022! In my free time, I love indie movies, books, and art! I also enjoy reverse engineering IoT devices.

If you're reading this I'd love to chat! Feel free to reach out at houlton.mcguinn@gmail.com.
