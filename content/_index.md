# it's nice to meet you :)

I'm **Houlton McGuinn,** a software engineer and security researcher. In 2023, I'll be starting my full-time career at [Retool](https://www.retool.com) as a Security Engineer in San Francisco!

I graduated from [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.cs.unc.edu) last December! In my free time, I love indie movies, books, and art! I also enjoy reverse engineering IoT devices.

If you're reading this I'd love to chat! Feel free to reach out at houlton.mcguinn@gmail.com.
