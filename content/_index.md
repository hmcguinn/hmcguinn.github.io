# it's nice to meet you :)

I'm **Houlton McGuinn,** a software engineer and security researcher. In 2022, I'll be interning at [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com) in San Francisco.

I'm studying computer science at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu). In my free time, I love indie movies, books, and art! I also enjoy reverse engineering IOT devices.

If you're reading this I'd love to chat! Feel free to reach out at houlton.mcguinn@gmail.com or [book a time](https://calendly.com/houlton/15min)!
