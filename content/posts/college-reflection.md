# My time at UNC

I grew up kind-off knowing I wanted to go to UNC, but not being sure if I would get in. Despite a lot (most) of my dads family attending, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get in because of how competitive it is out-of-state.

I ended up graduating from UNC after 3.5 semesters, but I was only really in Chapel Hill for 2.25 of those. Because of that and because of the timing of the semesters I missed (freshman spring and sophomore year), my experience was very different to a traditional one. I lost a lot of opportunities to  make and solidify friendships. This was exacerbated because I didn't have many friends going into my second semester because I spent the first preoccupied with pledging my fraternity that would later get shutdown for its involvement in a national drug bust.

# What I did at UNC

I was a computer science major all 4 years at UNC. I dabbled in some other minors -- family studies, astronomy, physics, and GIS but didn't end up completely them for one reason or another. The Computer Science department was also going through its own growing pains-- being forced to implement an application system to address overcrowding in the major. I took 401 (now 301) in my first semester and then was split between the old and new tracks. I ended up taking 401/410/211/311. I'm pretty happy with how this ended up working out.

Outside of my classes, I did research for one year for a professor in the business school. I also was an LA for COMP 435 (Computer Security Concepts) and later an LA for COMP 590 (Introduction to Cryptography). I also was involved with the Cybersecurity Club as co-President for 1.5 years and as a CS Student Ambassador for my junior year. Outside of all that, I had 4 different internships that introduced me to different areas of computer science, software engineering, and security.


# Graduating and moving

Today I'm leaving home and moving to San Francisco to start working. In the past I've always gone home regurarly-- for spring break, for Christmas, between semesters in the summer. Now, I've moved. I'll still go home some, but going home will be something I do to visit-- I'm not going home indefinitely. It's a big change and I don't think I've fully processed it. One thing that makes it especially different for me-- my dad moved to Germany. So even though my mom, brother, aunt, and dog will be at home when I visit, things aren't the same. I'm no longer returning to the nuclear family unit I belong to. I'm visiting somewhere I used to live. My friends are moving and getting jobs elsewhere. Some friend's parents have moved and they now go to DC for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Things aren't the same.

# San Francisco

Since high school, I've dreamed of moving to a big city and working in tech. There's something exciting about it. Especially San Francisco. Everyone it seems is connected to tech in some way. There are groups of people who meetup to talk about tech. Probably my most "wow" moment was visiting Noisebridge for an OWASP meeting. I got there a bit early and found their 8' tall gate open. I walked in and saw a group of people who were getting a tour. I see cables, development boards, and random electronic devices--- (read: junk) everywhere. Since there's still a bit of time until the meeting I take a seat. As the presentation draws closer, someone asks for help rearranging. I ask where I should put the chairs and tables we were moving. "Wherever, it's Noisebridge" he response. I remember thinking, "wow. this is what tech is really like". It was like HBO's Silicon Valley had come to life right in front of me.
