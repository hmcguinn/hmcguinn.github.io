I'm taking [Giving What We Can's Trial Pledge ðŸ”·](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/trial-pledge) to donate 10% of my income in 2025 to highly effective charities. 

#### Why I'm donating
I'm choosing to donate 10% of my income, because:

- As someone in the global top 1% by income, I have an extraordinary opportunity to help others
- I can use my money to do tangible good
- I want to live in a world where people who can help others, do 

Donating 10% is something I've thought about since college, but I delayed pulling the trigger because:

- I wanted to pay off my student loans 
- The opportunity cost of investing my donations for 30+ years made the "amount" I'd be giving up by donating much harder
 
I paid off my student loans earlier this year. My discount rate has also gone up significantly -- I'm much less confident about what the world will look like in 30 years[^1] and value near-term impact more highly. 

Reading about the 'Veil of Ignorance' thought experiment also resonated with me- if I had been born as someone less fortunate, or as a factory farmed animal, would I want those who had the opportunity to help to take action? My answer is a resounding yes.
#### Why share publicly?
I'm sharing my reasons for taking the Trial Pledge ðŸ”· because transparency around giving can [inspire others and shift social norms](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/should-charity-be-anonymous). Reading [others' reasons for donating](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/donation-pledge) influenced my decision. I hope that others might find value in my reasoning for donating and think that [incredible good can be accomplished if more people give](https://www.longview.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Longview-Report-If-the-1-percent-gave-10-percent.pdf). 

#### Where I'm donating
I plan to donate to [funds instead of individual charities](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/why-we-recommend-funds) because they have dedicated researchers who can evaluate opportunities more thoroughly, and can reallocate money as new needs emerge. Here's my planned allocations and reasoning:

- **[Long-Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future)** (45%) -- AI development is the most important thing happening right now in the world, and I'd argue in history. The decisions we make now will have a disproportionate impact on what the future looks like.  If you're not familiar, Holden Karnofsky's [Most Important Century](https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/) series is a great introduction to these ideas. There's an enormous amount at stake in getting this right.
- **[GiveWell's Top Charity Fund](https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund)** (30%) -  This fund focuses on evidence-based opportunities to save lives through global health interventions. GiveWell estimates that the [cost of saving a life ](https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life)through proven programs like malaria nets, vitamin A supplementation, and incentives for immunizations ranges between $3000 and $5500[^2].  Their [cost-effectiveness analyses are public ](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models)(and very detailed!) and this fund directs donations to charities with the highest marginal impact.
- **[Animal Welfare Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare)** (15%) - Factory farming creates a large amount of suffering in the world and funding for the welfare of farmed animals like pigs, chickens and fish is neglected . This fund supports projects to alleviate the suffering of farmed animals and other large populations of non-human animals.
- **[Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/)** (5%) - Rethink Priorities is focused on helping other organizations maximize their impact on the lives of humans and animals. They've done compelling research on the [moral weight's of different species ](https://rethinkpriorities.org/research-area/an-introduction-to-the-moral-weight-project/). They also have an [interesting calculator](https://rethinkpriorities.org/research-area/portfolio-builder-tool/) to build a portfolio of charitable allocations under different uncertainty and risk tolerance assumptions. In a lot of ways, the org seems to me to be a mix of non-profit, philosophy department, and startup. Overall, their [research areas](https://rethinkpriorities.org/our-research-areas/) are thought-provoking and I think will lead to more impact in the future.
- **[Shrimp Welfare Project](https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/)** (5%) - [5x more shrimp are farmed than land animals annually](https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/) and there's [growing evidence that shrimp can feel pain and may be sentient](https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient). Dollar-per-dollar, donations to shrimp welfare impact an enormous number of shrimp lives (~1500 shrimp per dollar). I recognize "why I'm donating to shrimp welfare" is weird and I think will be a great segue into discussing effective giving.

I'll evaluate my giving next year to decide whether to take the full 10% Pledge ðŸ”¶, continue my trial pledge ðŸ”·, or choose another path. 

If you're interested in effective giving, I'm happy to:
- Share resources that helped me decide to pledge
- Chat about different cause areas and their impact
- Talk through concerns or questions about giving/pledging

If you think you might benefit from discussing any of this, [please reach out](https://hmcguinn.com/)- I'm always happy to chat!
