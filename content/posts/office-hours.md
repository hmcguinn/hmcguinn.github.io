I'm starting open office hours to chat tech!

While I especially enjoy helping students and folks getting started in software/security (having just been there myself), I'm happy to talk with anyone.

## Why should you sign up? 

I'd encourage you to sign up if you think you'd benefit in any way! Some things we can do:

- Chat about tech, software development, or security
- Mock technical interviews - security or coding
- Discuss a project you're working on - I can provide feedback on your code, architecture, or specific errors you're hitting
- Brainstorm project ideas or career directions - sometimes it helps to bounce ideas off someone who's been there

## Why do I have office hours?

I've had a number of students reach out to ask for advice or to do a mock interview. While I don't think I have any insights that are particularly novel, I want to lower the friction of cold-DMing me and hope more people will take advantage. I've been helped by a ton of people and want to do the same.


## Get in touch

Shoot me an email at houlton.mcguinn@gmail.com with a little bit about who you are and what you'd like to talk about!
