# it's nice to meet you :)

I'm **Houlton McGuinn,** a software engineer and security researcher. I work on product security at [Harvey](https://harvey.ai). I previously worked on product security at [Character.AI](https://character.ai/) and did all things security at [Retool](https://retool.com).

I graduated from [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.cs.unc.edu) in December 2022. In my free time, I love indie movies, books, and art! I also enjoy reverse engineering IoT devices.

If you're reading this I'd love to chat! Feel free to reach out at houlton.mcguinn@gmail.com. I also do [office hours](posts/office-hours).
