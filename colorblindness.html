					<h1>On Colorblindness</h1>
					<p>Some of my experiences and thoughts on colorblindess.</p>
				</header>

				<p> People who know me know I'm colorblind. Once a week, I roll up to school wearing
					one color head-to-toe (usually blue). My finsta name is Anomalous Trichromat.
					I've embraced not being able to see color as a part of my identity. All the
					men in my immediate family are colorblind--my mom is a carrier and my dad is
					colorblind. I've known I'm colorblind since I was 8 or 9. A math test once
					asked me to group different color plates into three groups... I only grouped
					into two. I did not get the question right and only got credit after explaining
					the misunderstanding to my teacher.
				</p>

				<p>
					Colorblindness is fascinating [1]. For such a widespread condition, there is surprisingly little
					awareness of it. 8-10% of men and ~3% of women are colorblind. Yet, when I talk to mention my
					colorblindness to people it is almost always met with fascination. "What color is that" is
					invariably the next question someone asks after they find out I'm colorblind. Colorblindness is
					about unique perception of reality.
				</p>

				<p> With colorblindness, two people can stand next to each other and experience two unique realities.
					Even with two trichromats--do they see the same colors? Is there one, objective reality that
					everyone experiences? In terms of color--and vision--there is not. We perceive the world in
					different ways yet still experience the same world. Two people see the same apple. Yet, they
					perceive its redness differently. A colorblind man sees the apple less vibrantly but is his
					perception of the apple less valid? We each have a unique perception--yet equally valid--perception
					of the world. Debating which is "more" right is a useless exercise.
				</p>
				<p> Colorblindness is a reminder that we all have unique perceptions of the world. Our "self" is the
					product of past experiences and actions and cannot be separated from our current perception of the
					world. Like a lense, our past forms a filter through which we see the present. No lense is more or
					less correct, each filters differently.
				</p>
				<p> I wish I could see the world the "right" way. I wish I could see flowers and trees and paintings in
					all their vibrancy. I wish I wasn't suprised when someone points out the red berries on a bush.
					Enchroma makes glasses that are designed to "bring vibrant color to your world." I tried a pair and
					was genuinely surprised at the difference they made but not blown away. The glasses made everything
					slightly more saturated just like turning on an instagram filter. The most WOW moment I had was when
					driving past an office building on Lynhaven parkway. The red-brick building, one I had been driving
					by my whole life, suddenly was entirely different. The building did not change. The only change was
					the lense (literally) through which my perception of life was filtered.
				</p>
				<p> Describing color is HARD. On computers, we have the RGB (#99badd) system. Each red/green/blue is
					assigned a value between 0 and 255. This is where the 16 million colors (24-bit) that you hear about
					in advertising comes from. Printers use a similar system with magenta/yellow/cyan and black.
					Standardizing and describing colors is such big business that Pantone has an annual revenue of
					fifty-million dollars. Can you imagine a color you haven't seen?
				</p>
				<p> The philosophical reasoning behind this post is the idea of qualia. Qualia, according to Wikipedia,
					is "individual instances of subjective conscious experience". Alongside our uniquely personal
					experience of observing a painting, we as humans share a collective experience of that painting.
					Describing our personal experience is a much harder task than relating to the shared experience of a
					friend who also sees that same painting. My perception of a colorful painting is then viewed through
					the lense of me not being able to experience all the colors the "proper" way. I physically see a and
					feelings different painting than someone standing next to me. Yet, our shared experience of that
					painting can be similar. It can evoke the same emotions
				</p>
				<p> Since thinking more about my colorblindness and talking about it with people. I don't know. I'm
					really not sure where to go with this.
				</p>
				<p> [1] I use the term colorblindness and color deficiency interchangeably. While not technically
					correct, color deficiency is colloquially referred to as colorblindness. More correctly, only people
					with achromatic vision are truly "blind" to colors and see in black and white. Achromats are
					extremely rare.
