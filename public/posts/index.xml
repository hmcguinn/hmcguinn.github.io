      <description>Introduction The Department of Defense launched their vulnerablity disclosure program (VDP) in 2016. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in bug bounty/VDPs for awhile but never actually gave them a try. I chose to investigate this particular program because I thought it would be relatively easier to find a vulnerability in a huge legacy organization like the DoD. And it worked! In a couple of hours I was able to find, validate, and submit my first vulnerability.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in astronomy and space since I was a kid, but never really did much with it. During my internship at Georgia Tech Research Institute, I learned to use a software-defined radio to investigate vulnerabilities in an IOT camera&amp;rsquo;s over-the-air communication protocol. Reading this post on using an SDR to detect pulsars inspired me. What else could you detect with one? Being interested in both astronomy and SDRs, this project naturally followed.</description>
