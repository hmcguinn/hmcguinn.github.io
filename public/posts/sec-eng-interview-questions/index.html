<p>(Un)-fortunately, there&rsquo;s no standardized Leetcode-esque interview process for security engineers <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. There are a number of online resources for security engineer interview questions, but I found them to be too high level (explain encoding vs encryption vs hashing) compared to interviews I&rsquo;ve been in. A lot didn&rsquo;t have answers. I spent some time prepping when I switched jobs earlier this year, and this is my attempt to collate some interesting questions + answers all in one place!</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<h2 id="cryptography">Cryptography</h2>
<h5 id="whats-the-difference-between-symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption">What&rsquo;s the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?</h5>
<p>Symmetric encryption is like having a shared safe combination - both Alice and Bob need to know the exact same secret to encrypt and decrypt messages. Simple, but there&rsquo;s a catch: how do they securely share that secret in the first place?</p>
<p>Asymmetric encryption solves this with public/private key pairs. Alice can encrypt with Bob&rsquo;s public key (which can be shared freely), and <em>only</em> Bob can decrypt it with his matching private key. When Bob wants to reply, he uses Alice&rsquo;s public key, and only she can read it with her private key.</p>
<p>Why pick one over the other? Symmetric encryption is faster but requires that shared secret problem to be solved first. Asymmetric is perfect for one-way communication (like sending someone an encrypted email) since you only need their public key. This is why most real-world systems (like TLS) use both - asymmetric to exchange a symmetric key, then symmetric for the actual data.</p>
<h5 id="does-tls-use-asymmetric-or-symmetric-encryption">Does TLS use asymmetric or symmetric encryption?</h5>
<p>Both! TLS starts with an asymmetric handshake to securely exchange keys (solving the <strong>hard</strong> problem of how to share a secret), then switches to symmetric encryption for the actual data because it&rsquo;s <em>way</em> faster.</p>
<p>When a client connects, it tells the server what cipher suites it supports. These are strings like <code>TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code> that specify both the asymmetric part (like ECDHE-RSA for key exchange) and symmetric part (like AES-256-GCM for bulk encryption). A server might support multiple suites, but modern TLS prefers AEAD ciphers like AES-GCM.</p>
<h5 id="explain-envelope-encryption">Explain envelope encryption</h5>
<p>Data at rest needs encryption, but encrypting <em>everything</em> with one key is asking for trouble. Instead, use envelope encryption: generate data encryption keys (DEKs) for your actual data, then wrap those DEKs with a key encryption key (KEK).</p>
<p>This is nice for a few reasons: it limits how much data gets encrypted with any single key (important for key wear-out), makes key rotation way easier (just re-wrap the DEKs with a new KEK), and contains the blast radius if a key is compromised.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/tink">Tink</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/choose-keyring.html">AWS Encryption SDK</a> are two libraries that support this pattern.  <a href="https://slack.engineering/engineering-dive-into-slack-enterprise-key-management/">Slack wrote a great piece on their engineering blog</a> about building their Enterprise Key Management system on these principles.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-differences-between-aes-gcm-and-aes-cbc-why-might-you-prefer-one-over-the-other">What are the differences between AES-GCM and AES-CBC? Why might you prefer one over the other?</h5>
<p>GCM gives you encryption <em>and</em> integrity in one package (it&rsquo;s an AEAD cipher) while CBC only handles encryption. You need to add a MAC to CBC yourself, and getting that wrong is a common source of vulnerabilities (<a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/02/04/luckythirteen.html">Lucky 13</a>).</p>
<p>IV reuse is interesting here - CBC degrades somewhat gracefully while GCM <a href="https://hmcguinn.com/posts/cryptopals-set-3/">completely falls apart</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES-GCM-SIV">GCM-SIV</a> is another option similar to GCM, and is slightly slower but way more forgiving.</p>
<p>GCM can decrypt things in parallel which seems nice, but breaks the integrity guarantees if you modify blocks independently. This has bitten real implementations that tried to be &ldquo;clever&rdquo; with random access before.</p>
<h5 id="a-cookie-is-signed-with-hk--m---is-this-secure">A cookie is signed with H(k | m) - is this secure?</h5>
<p>Nope! This falls to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack">length extension attack</a>. If you know H(k | m), you can continue hashing from there without knowing k. The attacker reconstructs the hash&rsquo;s internal state and can append whatever they want to the message.</p>
<p>This bites a lot of hash functions - SHA-1, SHA-2, MD5 all use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction">Merkle-Damgård construction</a> which makes them vulnerable. SHA-3 dodges this by using a sponge construction. Interestingly, truncated variants like SHA-512/256 and SHA-384 are also safe since attackers can&rsquo;t reconstruct the full internal state from the truncated output.</p>
<p>Want to do this right? Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a>. It&rsquo;s specifically designed to avoid these pitfalls and it&rsquo;s available in every major crypto library. H(m | k) is not vulnerable, but it&rsquo;s still better to just use HMAC.</p>
<h5 id="explain-certificate-transparency-ct-logs">Explain certificate transparency (CT) logs</h5>
<p><a href="https://emilymstark.com/2020/07/20/certificate-transparency-a-birds-eye-view.html">This</a> post by Emily Stark is a great overview of CT logs. The cliff notes:</p>
<p>Certificate transparency (CT) logs are an auditable record of issued TLS certificates. CT logs enforce transparency for CAs and create a record of what certificates are issued for a domain. CT logs have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates">caught CA compromises before</a>!</p>
<p>Before issuing a certificate, certificate authorities (CA) will submit a precertificate with a poisoned field indicating it should not be used to the CT log. A signed certificate timestamp gets returned to the CA, who can then issue the certificate with the SCT attached.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency#browser_requirements">Safari and Chrome both require</a> that certificates trusted by the browser be recorded in a CT log. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1281469">Firefox interestingly does not</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, CT logs use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> as an append-only ledger. Sometimes, <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/ct-policy/c/S17_j-WJ6dI">bit-flips happen</a> which leads to the whole CT log needing to be thrown out and replaced.</p>
<p>A side-effect of certificates being recorded in CT logs is that information about subdomains becomes public. You can use <a href="https://crt.sh">crt.sh</a> to search for certificates.</p>
<h5 id="whats-the-difference-between-hashing-and-signing">What&rsquo;s the difference between hashing and signing?</h5>
<p>Anyone can compute the hash of something. Hashes are collision resistant, meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can&rsquo;t find two different inputs that hash to the same output (collision resistance)</li>
<li>Given a hash output, you can&rsquo;t find an input that produces it (preimage resistance)</li>
<li>Tiny changes to the input produce a completely different hash (avalanche effect)</li>
</ul>
<p>Checking a message&rsquo;s hash verifies its integrity &ndash; it proves the message hasn&rsquo;t been tampered with. But since anyone can compute a new hash for a modified message, hashing alone doesn&rsquo;t prove who created or modified it.</p>
<p>A digital signature provides both authenticity (proving who signed it) and integrity (proving it hasn&rsquo;t been modified). Signing requires the private key, while anyone can verify the signature. Modern signature schemes like EdDSA, RSA, and ECDSA sign a hash of the message instead of the raw message. This has a couple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency (hashing reduces large messages to a fixed size)</li>
<li>Security (prevents mathematical attacks possible with raw signatures)</li>
<li>Proper integrity checking (even a 1-bit change completely changes the hash and invalidates the signature)</li>
</ul>
<p>This also means that the security of a signature scheme relies on the hash&ndash; a second input that hashes to the same value would also verify successfully!</p>
<h2 id="web-security">Web security</h2>
<h5 id="how-can-you-protect-against-ssrf">How can you protect against SSRF?</h5>
<p>Input validation is the first layer here &ndash; allowlist URL schemes or domains for inputs that come from the client. There are <strong>tons</strong> of ways to bypass input validation so this is not sufficient. TOCTOU DNS rebinding attacks can also happen. <a href="https://emily.id.au/tailscale">CVE-2022-41924</a> is a great read about a RCE in Tailscale on Windows that exploited this.</p>
<p>In Node, you can use a <a href="https://github.com/azu/request-filtering-agent">http.Agent to filter requests to private ranges</a>. Network-level protections should also be enabled, disable access to RFC 1918 ranges using iptables.</p>
<p>Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254) are a juicy target for SSRF - AWS IMDSv1 was particularly bad since a single SSRF could grab the credentials. Block these at the network level <em>and</em> enforce IMDSv2 which fixes this by requiring PUT requests and custom headers. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.html">hop limit can also be set to a max of 2</a>.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-cors-what-does-it-protect-against">What is CORS? What does it protect against?</h5>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> (cross-origin resource sharing) is a security mechanism that allows sites to relax the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a> (SOP) and indicate what other origins the browser should allow loading resources from.</p>
<p>CORS protects against cross-origin attacks by requiring servers to explicitly opt-in to allowing other <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#definition_of_an_origin">origins</a> reading responses. If making a complex cross-origin request (like a PUT or DELETE with custom headers), the browser will send a pre-flight request. Servers specify what headers are allowed through <code>Access-Control-Allow-*</code> headers in the pre-flight request response.</p>
<p>CORS does <strong>not</strong> protect against cross-origin requests from being made, only reading the responses. For state-changing operations, <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#token-based-mitigation">CSRF tokens</a> should be used.</p>
<h5 id="youre-building-a-markdown-editor-that-lets-users-edit-html-how-can-you-protect-against-xss">You&rsquo;re building a markdown editor that lets users edit HTML, how can you protect against XSS?</h5>
<p>Markdown parsers are XSS nightmares because they&rsquo;re designed to <em>allow</em> HTML - that&rsquo;s part of the spec! First, decide if you really need raw HTML support. If you don&rsquo;t, use a strict markdown-only parser and strip all HTML tags.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> need HTML, there&rsquo;s two main options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify">DOMPurify</a> to sanitize. It handles weird edge cases like nested parsers and DOM clobbering.</li>
<li>Render the HTML in a sandboxed iframe with <code>sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts&quot;</code>. This isolates the origin and contains any XSS to the sandboxed frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to watch out for is injecting dynamic content after sanitization. If the editor lets users inject variables or templates into the markdown (like <code>${user.name}</code>), you need to sanitize at render time, not just at parse time.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-security">Cloud security</h2>
<h5 id="youve-found-an-ssrf-vulnerability-running-on-a-eks-instance-how-can-you-exploit-this">You&rsquo;ve found an SSRF vulnerability running on a EKS instance, how can you exploit this?</h5>
<p>Since this is running on AWS, the natural thing to check is if you can exploit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html#imds-considerations">AWS Metadata Endpoint at 169.254.169.254</a>. Assuming you can, you can <a href="https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/exploitation/ec2-metadata-ssrf/#stealing-iam-credentials-from-the-instance-metadata-service">retrieve the IAM credentials</a> associated with the underlying EC2 instance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html">default role</a> for EKS nodes is attached to these policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy</code></li>
<li><code>AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPullOnly</code></li>
<li><code>AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Christophe Tafani-Dereeper has a <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/privilege-escalation-in-aws-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks-by-compromising-the-instance-role-of-worker-nodes/">great post</a> that goes more in-depth on this topic. Some bad things you can do from their post:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Map the network, by <strong>listing and describing VPCs, subnets, and security groups</strong>. Not only the VPC associated to the EKS cluster, but <em>across the whole AWS account.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Describe <em>any EC2 instance</em></strong> <em>in the AWS account.</em> This includes information such as the AMI used, private IP, disks attached…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nuke <em>all network interfaces</em></strong> _of every EC2 instance with successive calls to <em>ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces</em>, <em>ec2:DetachNetworkInterface</em>, and <em>ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface</em>. This will bring offline all your instances and dependent AWS managed services. Your fancy EKS cluster? Gone. Your highly-available, auto-scalable web application spanning in 3 AZs? Offline. Great attack vector for a denial of service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enumerate and pull any Docker image</strong> (“<em>ECR repository</em>“) in the account. As a bonus, you can even query the image vulnerability scan results by calling <em>ecr:DescribeImageScanFindings</em>. This will give you a nice list of the vulnerabilities <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html">identified</a> by AWS in these images. This can be very helpful for further exploitation of pods inside the EKS cluster. Who needs Nessus anyway?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, all this is <strong>AWS account-wide</strong>, comes by default when spinning up an EKS cluster, and is accessible by only having compromised a single, underprivileged pod in the cluster.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re able to read files with the SSRF, you can check <code>/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token</code> for service account tokens associated with the cluster which often have way more permissions than needed. Found one that can list pods? Cool, now you can see <em>all</em> the environment variables they&rsquo;re injecting, including other services&rsquo; credentials.</p>
<h2 id="application-security">Application security</h2>
<h5 id="a-secret-key-was-committed-to-our-github-repository-what-steps-need-to-be-taken">A secret key was committed to our Github repository, what steps need to be taken?</h5>
<p>This happens often, it&rsquo;s very easy to do (0.1% of all Github pushes have secrets!), and ideally should be prevented through better tooling. Visit <a href="https://howtorotate.com">HowToRotate</a> and follow the steps there.</p>
<p><a href="https://trufflesecurity.com">Trufflehog</a> has great research on all the ways secrets can stick around. Basically, once someone runs <code>git push</code>, it&rsquo;s impossible to scrub. If the push is to a public repository, it&rsquo;ll likely be automatically revoked through <a href="https://github.com/advanced-security/GSSAR">GitHub Secret Scanner Auto Remediator</a>. Hopefully before an attacker grabs it, which usually takes about 10 minutes. If the key is in a private repository, you have a little bit more time.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-you-prevent-secrets-from-getting-logged-in-an-application">How can you prevent secrets from getting logged in an application?</h5>
<p>This is actually a pretty tricky problem&ndash; secrets have a nasty habit of sneaking into logs through error messages, debug traces, and HTTP traces. In 2018, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twitter-admits-recording-plaintext-passwords-in-internal-logs-just-like-github/">Twitter logged plaintext passwords</a>.</p>
<p>Getting this right requires a lot of trial and error, and playing Whack-A-Mole as new log sites get added. At a high level, making sure secrets are scoped to areas where they&rsquo;re needed and not getting passed around all over the application makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Languages like Python and JavaScript let you override <code>__str__</code> or <code>toJSON</code> methods on sensitive objects. <a href="https://github.com/transcend-io/secret-value">secret-value</a> is a Typescript library that does this for you by wrapping secrets in an object. If your application uses a logging library like <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">Winston</a> or <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html">Log4j</a>, you can modify the log stream to redact information.</p>
<p>An area that I&rsquo;m not particularly familiar with, but is also worth knowing about is crash dumps. <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/results-of-major-technical-investigations-for-storm-0558-key-acquisition/">Storm-0558 hacked into US Cabinet emails through a Microsoft crash dump</a> that didn&rsquo;t have the signing keys scrubbed.</p>
<p>Another approach is to inject canary values and alert if they appear in logs. Then, you can go and fix where in your application they&rsquo;re coming from. The <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sensitive-data-scanner">core of Datadog&rsquo;s sensitive data scanner</a> library which is designed to detect secrets in logs is open-source on Github.</p>
<h4 id="why-are-jwts-hard-to-rotate-and-what-common-mitigations-exist">Why are JWTs hard to rotate and what common mitigations exist?</h4>
<p>JWTs are designed to be stateless- the token contains all the state needed to check their validity and they often contain user session information to minimize the need for database lookups. Since there is no database session row to invalidate, it&rsquo;s hard to rotate them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few ways around this, each that comes with tradeoffs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-lived tokens:</strong> if a token is only valid for a short amount of time, there&rsquo;s less impact if one is compromised since it will expire shortly.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple verification keys:</strong> JWT&rsquo;s support a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1.4">kid</a> header, which specifies which key was used to sign the JWT. This lets you rotate the key used to sign the JWT.</li>
<li><strong>Token blacklist:</strong> you can introduce a cache of JWTs or user ids that are revoked. This requires a cache check on every request which defeats some of the benefits of JWTs in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<h5 id="how-would-you-design-login-for-a-web-app">How would you design login for a web app?</h5>
<p>This question covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password storage (bcrypt), maybe 2FA</li>
<li>Session revocation (session table, JWT)</li>
</ul>
<p>My first answer is &ldquo;don&rsquo;t - instead use oauth with Github/Google&rdquo;, but that makes the question much less interesting!</p>
<h5 id="we-want-to-design-a-system-to-run-user-code-how-can-we-sandbox-it">We want to design a system to run user code, how can we sandbox it?</h5>
<p>The right approach depends a lot on the use-case, some potential questions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the system latency sensitive? A REPL needs sub-second response times while a batch job might tolerate 30+ seconds of startup overhead</li>
<li>Write/Run ratio for code (REPL vs cron job) - if code runs frequently, you&rsquo;ll want to optimize for fast startup and maybe even keep &ldquo;warm&rdquo; sandboxes ready</li>
<li>What is the code doing? Does it need to interact with packages, drivers, or hardware? Network access? File system persistence?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some easier options, that don&rsquo;t provide perfect security:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda
<ul>
<li>Lambdas will get re-used between invocations, and an attacker can potentially modify state (the <code>/tmp</code> directory persists!) to affect the next invocation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docker container
<ul>
<li>A container is generally not a strong security boundary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Language-level sandboxing
<ul>
<li>Python&rsquo;s RestrictedPython, Java SecurityManager are options. These are generally not sufficient on their own and there&rsquo;s a lot of escape hatches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some better options:</p>
<ul>
<li>VM
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> each VM receives its own kernel, great isolation, well-understood security properties</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> large amount of overhead, slow startup times (10s+ seconds), resource intensive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nsjail: an open-source sandboxing library
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> flexible with where it can run, low overhead, configurable resource limits</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Linux-only, depends on kernel features being available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firecracker: micro VM
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> fast (sub-second startup possible), strong isolation, minimal memory footprint</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> needs to be run on bare metal machines, much more expensive if you&rsquo;re using a cloud provider</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>gVisor
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> implements its own security-focused kernel interface, good compromise between containers and VMs</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> compatibility issues with some applications, performance overhead for system calls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>V8 Isolates - Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/mitigating-spectre-and-other-security-threats-the-cloudflare-workers-security-model/">uses this for Workers</a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> lightweight, fast startup, great for JavaScript workloads, strong memory isolation</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> JavaScript/V8 only, some V8 bugs can cross isolation boundaries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you use has a lot more considerations than just security. How do you handle networking? Package installation? What about memory limits and CPU quotas? How much does it cost to run?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on writing an in-depth dive comparing different sandboxing technologies and who uses what. More to come on that later!</p>
