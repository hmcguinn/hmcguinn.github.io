My discount rate has also gone up significantly &ndash; I&rsquo;m much less confident about what the world will look like in 30 years<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> and value near-term impact more highly.</p><p>Reading about the &lsquo;Veil of Ignorance&rsquo; thought experiment also resonated with me- if I had been born as someone less fortunate, or as a factory farmed animal, would I want those who had the opportunity to help to take action? My answer is a resounding yes.</p><h4 id=why-share-publicly>Why share publicly?</h4><p>I&rsquo;m sharing my reasons for taking the Trial Pledge ðŸ”· because transparency around giving can <a href=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/should-charity-be-anonymous>inspire others and shift social norms</a>. Reading <a href=https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/donation-pledge>others&rsquo; reasons for donating</a> influenced my decision. I hope that others might find value in my reasoning for donating and think that <a href=https://www.longview.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Longview-Report-If-the-1-percent-gave-10-percent.pdf>incredible good can be accomplished if more people give</a>.</p><h4 id=where-im-donating>Where I&rsquo;m donating</h4><p>I plan to donate to <a href=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/why-we-recommend-funds>funds instead of individual charities</a> because they have dedicated researchers who can evaluate opportunities more thoroughly, and can reallocate money as new needs emerge. Here&rsquo;s my planned allocations and reasoning:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future>Long-Term Future Fund</a></strong> (45%) &ndash; AI development is the most important thing happening right now in the world, and I&rsquo;d argue in history. The decisions we make now will have a disproportionate impact on what the future looks like. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, Holden Karnofsky&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/>Most Important Century</a> series is a great introduction to these ideas. There&rsquo;s an enormous amount at stake in getting this right.</li><li><strong><a href=https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund>GiveWell&rsquo;s Top Charity Fund</a></strong> (30%) - This fund focuses on evidence-based opportunities to save lives through global health interventions. GiveWell estimates that the <a href=https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life>cost of saving a life </a>through proven programs like malaria nets, vitamin A supplementation, and incentives for immunizations ranges between $3000 and $5500<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. Their <a href=https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models>cost-effectiveness analyses are public </a>(and very detailed!) and this fund directs donations to charities with the highest marginal impact.</li><li><strong><a href=https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare>Animal Welfare Fund</a></strong> (15%) - Factory farming creates a large amount of suffering in the world and funding for the welfare of farmed animals like pigs, chickens and fish is neglected . This fund supports projects to alleviate the suffering of farmed animals and other large populations of non-human animals.</li><li><strong><a href=https://rethinkpriorities.org/>Rethink Priorities</a></strong> (5%) - Rethink Priorities is focused on helping other organizations maximize their impact on the lives of humans and animals. They&rsquo;ve done compelling research on the <a href=https://rethinkpriorities.org/research-area/an-introduction-to-the-moral-weight-project/>moral weight&rsquo;s of different species </a>. They also have an <a href=https://rethinkpriorities.org/research-area/portfolio-builder-tool/>interesting calculator</a> to build a portfolio of charitable allocations under different uncertainty and risk tolerance assumptions. In a lot of ways, the org seems to me to be a mix of non-profit, philosophy department, and startup. Overall, their <a href=https://rethinkpriorities.org/our-research-areas/>research areas</a> are thought-provoking and I think will lead to more impact in the future.</li><li><strong><a href=https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/>Shrimp Welfare Project</a></strong> (5%) - <a href=https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/>5x more shrimp are farmed than land animals annually</a> and there&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient>growing evidence that shrimp can feel pain and may be sentient</a>. Dollar-per-dollar, donations to shrimp welfare impact an enormous number of shrimp lives (~1500 shrimp per dollar). I recognize &ldquo;why I&rsquo;m donating to shrimp welfare&rdquo; is weird and I think will be a great segue into discussing effective giving.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ll evaluate my giving next year to decide whether to take the full 10% Pledge ðŸ”¶, continue my trial pledge ðŸ”·, or choose another path.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in effective giving, I&rsquo;m happy to:</p><ul><li>Share resources that helped me decide to pledge</li><li>Chat about different cause areas and their impact</li><li>Talk through concerns or questions about giving/pledging</li></ul><p>If you think you might benefit from discussing any of this, <a href=https://hmcguinn.com/>please reach out</a>- I&rsquo;m always happy to chat!</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>AI is the elephant in the room here.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>This number obviously comes with uncertainty, but is highly researched.&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></main><footer><script defer src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script defer src=//yihui.org/js/center-img.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=/themes/custom.css><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-YT0WLW116B"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-YT0WLW116B")</script><hr>Â© <a href=https://hmcguinn.com>Houlton McGuinn</a> 2020 &ndash; 2025 | <a href=https://github.com/hmcguinn>Github</a></footer></body></html>
