&lt;p>While I especially enjoy helping students and folks getting started in software/security (having just been there myself), I&amp;rsquo;m happy to talk with anyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-should-you-sign-up">Why should you sign up?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to sign up if you think you&amp;rsquo;d benefit in any way! Some things we can do:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Chat about tech, software development, or security&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mock technical interviews - security or coding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss a project you&amp;rsquo;re working on - I can provide feedback on your code, architecture, or specific errors you&amp;rsquo;re hitting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brainstorm project ideas or career directions - sometimes it helps to bounce ideas off someone who&amp;rsquo;s been there&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-do-i-have-office-hours">Why do I have office hours?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of students reach out to ask for advice or to do a mock interview. While I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have any insights that are particularly novel, I want to lower the friction of cold-DMing me and hope more people will take advantage. I&amp;rsquo;ve been helped by a ton of people and want to do the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Donating 10% ðŸ”·</title><link>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/donating-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 11:23:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/donating-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m taking &lt;a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/trial-pledge">Giving What We Can&amp;rsquo;s Trial Pledge ðŸ”·&lt;/a> to donate 10% of my income in 2025 to highly effective charities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="why-im-donating">Why I&amp;rsquo;m donating&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m choosing to donate 10% of my income, because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>As someone in the global top 1% by income, I have an extraordinary opportunity to help others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I can use my money to do tangible good&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to live in a world where people who can help others, do&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Donating 10% is something I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about since college, but I delayed pulling the trigger because:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding a command injection vulnerability in my smart thermostat (CVE-2023-4212)</title><link>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/command-injection-vulnerability/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 00:04:34 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/command-injection-vulnerability/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I discovered a vulnerability allowing arbitrary command injection as root in &lt;a href="https://www.trane.com/residential/en/products/thermostats-and-controls/smart-thermostats/">Trane XL824, XL850, XL1050, and Pivot smart thermostats&lt;/a> using a specially crafted filename. The vulnerability has existed since at least 2015 and requires physical access to the device via a USB drive. All affected devices will automatically update.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4212">CVE-2023-4212&lt;/a> was assigned to this vulnerability and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) published an ICS advisory &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-234-02">here&lt;/a>. The CVSS score is 6.8 &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H">CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cryptopals Set 3: Block &amp; stream crypto</title><link>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/cryptopals-set-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 10:15:11 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/cryptopals-set-3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="17-the-cbc-padding-oracle">17. The CBC padding oracle&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is the best-known attack on modern block-cipher cryptography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Combine your padding code and your CBC code to write two functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first function should select at random one of the following 10 strings:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>MDAwMDAwTm93IHRoYXQgdGhlIHBhcnR5IGlzIGp1bXBpbmc=

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip; generate a random AES key (which it should save for all future encryptions), pad the string out to the 16-byte AES block size and CBC-encrypt it under that key, providing the caller the ciphertext and IV.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cryptopals Set 2: Block crypto</title><link>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/cryptopals-set-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:00:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/cryptopals-set-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Continuing with &lt;a href="https://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals&lt;/a>, the second set focuses on block ciphers.

&lt;h2 id="9-implement-pkcs7-padding">9. Implement PKCS#7 Padding&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A block cipher transforms a fixed-sized block (usually 8 or 16 bytes) of plaintext into ciphertext. But we almost never want to transform a single block; we encrypt irregularly-sized messages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way we account for irregularly-sized messages is by padding, creating a plaintext that is an even multiple of the blocksize. The most popular padding scheme is called PKCS#7.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cryptopals Set 1: Basics</title><link>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/cryptopals-set-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 13:12:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/cryptopals-set-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cryptopals.com">Cryptopals&lt;/a> is a set of cryptography challenges by the NCC Group. Maciej Ceglowski wrote a great blog about them &lt;a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/">here&lt;/a>. They&amp;rsquo;ve been out for a while and I originally tried to work through them four years ago in high school. I got to about the second challenge and then was stumped. Now, four years and a CS degree later, I&amp;rsquo;m back at it! They&amp;rsquo;ve been a ton of fun to work on so far and definitely challenging. I&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; academically a lot of the attacks covered but implementing them is a different story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automated Backyard Hydrogen Line Astronomy</title><link>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/hydrogen-line/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 23:19:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hmcguinn.com/posts/hydrogen-line/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in astronomy and space since I was a kid, but never really did much with it. During my internship at &lt;a href="https://gtri.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech Research Institute&lt;/a>, I learned to use a software-defined radio to investigate vulnerabilities in an IOT camera&amp;rsquo;s over-the-air communication protocol. Reading &lt;a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/cheap-and-easy-hydrogen-line-radio-astronomy-with-a-rtl-sdr-wifi-parabolic-grid-dish-lna-and-sdrsharphttps://www.rtl-sdr.com/detecting-pulsars-rotating-neutron-stars-with-an-rtl-sdr//">this post&lt;/a> on using an SDR to detect pulsars inspired me.
