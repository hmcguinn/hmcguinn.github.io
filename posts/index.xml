These were a lot of fun! Trickier than the second set but also more useful and fun to work on!
9. Implement PKCS#7 Padding A block cipher transforms a fixed-sized block (usually 8 or 16 bytes) of plaintext into ciphertext. But we almost never want to transform a single block; we encrypt irregularly-sized messages.
One way we account for irregularly-sized messages is by padding, creating a plaintext that is an even multiple of the blocksize.</description></item><item><title>Cryptopals Set 1: Basics</title><link>/posts/cryptopals-set-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 13:12:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/cryptopals-set-1/</guid><description>Cryptopals is a set of cryptography challenges by the NCC Group. Maciej Ceglowski wrote a great blog about them here. They&amp;rsquo;ve been out for a while and I originally tried to work through them four years ago in high school. I got to about the second challenge and then was stumped. Now, four years and a CS degree later, I&amp;rsquo;m back at it! They&amp;rsquo;ve been a ton of fun to work on so far and definitely challenging.</description></item><item><title>Automated Backyard Hydrogen Line Astronomy</title><link>/posts/hydrogen-line/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 23:19:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/hydrogen-line/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in astronomy and space since I was a kid, but never really did much with it. During my internship at Georgia Tech Research Institute, I learned to use a software-defined radio to investigate vulnerabilities in an IOT camera&amp;rsquo;s over-the-air communication protocol. Reading this post on using an SDR to detect pulsars inspired me. What else could you detect with one? Being interested in both astronomy and SDRs, this project naturally followed.</description></item></channel></rss>
